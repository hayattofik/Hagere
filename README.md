# Hagere
Hagere is a website that allows the public to interact with the government in order to solve problems. We open the door for government sectors to collaborate with the public in areas such as economics, agriculture, and technology. The ministerial offices and key governmental organizations will post challenges (problems to be solved), and the public will be able to do one of two things. The first is to leave a comment, while the second is to submit a formal proposal of their ideas. This website will bridge the gap between the government and the people. Furthermore, it encourages people to focus on problem solving and fosters a sense of unity and patriotism among us.
